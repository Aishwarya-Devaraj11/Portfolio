    ------>In today’s world, we cannot imagine only one day without using
    electrical or electronic gadgets.The rapid growth of urbanization and
    industrialization has led to an increase in ambient noise levels. This
    project proposes an innovative approach to harness this noise pollution and
    convert it into a useful form of energy - electricity. The project aims to
    design a system that captures ambient noise, converts it into electrical
    energy, and utilizes blockchain technology for efficient energy management.

    [1].The first part of the project focuses on the design and development of a
    noise-to-electricity converter. This device captures ambient noise and
    converts it into electrical energy through a process known as
    piezoelectricity. The generated electricity is then stored in a battery for
    later use.
  </p>
  <p class="pt-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-xl pl-8 pr-5">
    [2].The second part of the project involves the application of blockchain
    technology for energy management. Each noise-to-electricity converter is
    considered a node in the blockchain network. The energy generated by each
    node is recorded and managed using blockchain, ensuring transparency,
    security, and efficiency in energy distribution.

  <p class="mb-3 pl-10 pr-3 text-lg text-black font-bold">[1]:WIND ENERGY</p>
  <p class="text-black pl-20 pr-3">
    Wind power now represents a major and growing source of renewable energy.
    Large wind turbines (with capacities of up to 6-8 MW) are widely installed
    in power distribution networks. Increasing numbers of onshore and offshore
    wind farms, acting as power plants, are connected directly to power
    transmission networks at the scale of hundreds of megawatts

  <p class="mb-3 pl-10 pt-3  text-lg text-black font-bold">[2]:SOLAR ENERGY</p>
  <p class="text-black pl-20 pr-3">
    The existing system is to consume the maximum solar energy through solar
    panel. A Solar Tracker is a device onto which solar panels are built-in
    which tracks the motion of the sun ensuring that maximum amount of sunlight
    strikes the panels all over the day. Solar tracking allows more energy to be
    produced because the solar array is able to remain aligned to the sun.

    [3]:GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM NOISE
  </p>
  <p class="text-black pl-20 pr-3">
    Existing systems focus on converting ambient noise into electrical energy.
    This is typically achieved through a process known as piezoelectricity,
    where mechanical strain (caused by sound waves) on certain materials
    generates an electric charge. The generated electricity can then be stored
    in a battery for later use.

  <p class="text-black pl-20 pr-3">
    There are multiple sources of sound which go unnoticed, most of them is the noise generated by industries, public area, etc. The use of transducers to convert sound waves (noise pollution) into energy demonstrates that noise can act as an alternative source of energy.
    Similar to existing systems, ambient noise will be converted into electrical energy. However, each converter will also be equipped with the necessary technology to connect to a blockchain network.
